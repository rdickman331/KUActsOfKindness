## Sarah Polo
 
Sarah Polo is a PhD student and fellow in Rhetoric and Composition at the University of Kansas. Her research interests vary widely, ranging from digital literacies and digital composing to curriculum design and best practices for writing instruction. Her current work focuses on women in early academia through examining archived writings of women students in the nineteenth and early twentieth-century, thus using understandings of previous educational practices to inform contemporary writing pedagogy.  At the same time, she is interested in furthering connections between scholarly archival practices and the composition classroom, finding meaningful ways to integrate archival research methods into studentsâ€™ work in English general education courses.
