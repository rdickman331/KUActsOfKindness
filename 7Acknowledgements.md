The KU Kindness Project would not be possible without the guidance and support of our mentors, colleagues, and fellow digital humanists.

We'd first like to thank the [University of Kansas](http://ku.edu) and the [KU Institute for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://idrh.ku.edu/), without which the Digital Humanities 690 seminar would not be possible. As the pioneer students of this first-time seminar, we hope we've left a worthy legacy for future DHers at KU--one that will spur our institution toward increasing interest in the field and methodologies of the digital humanities. 

Of course, we also have to give our many, many thanks to Dr. Elika Ortega for her unending patience with our learning process (a patience that proves very neccessary when working with glitchy technology), continually helpful feedback, and cheers for our big and small successes alike. 

We'd also like to thank all the guest speakers and scholars, including Brian Rosenblum, Johanna Drucker, Rhonda Houser, and Pam Lach, who gave their time and expertise to the DH seminar.  

Lastly, thank you to the [University of Kansas Libraries](https://lib.ku.edu/) for allowing us to present and display the KU Acts of Kindness Project at its Digital Humanities Showcase on December 10, 2015. 

For the Hyde layout on Jekyll, all acknowledgments go to the template's creator, Mark Otto.
